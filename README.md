<h1>What is this project?</h1>
<p>
It's a cool thing I made as a capstone project!<br>
It's a mock news website made for my neighborhood. Very basic in design with a lot of room for improvement, but very practical when considering how real news websites work.
</p>

<h1>What technologies were used?</h1>
<p>Axios for the front end, Express for the back end, and PostgreSQL for the article database.<br> 
Later on, I plan to remake this in React for my specialization project.
</p>

<h1>What are the functionalities?</h1>
<p>Users are able to view a list of articles on the front page, read individual articles, submit their own articles, and go to a random/featured article.</p>
