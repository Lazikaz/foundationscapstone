<h1>What is this project?</h1>
<p>
It's a cool thing I made as a capstone project!<br>
It's a mock news website made for my neighborhood. Users are able to view, read, and submit their own articles.
</p>

<h1>What technologies were used?</h1>
<p>Axios for the front end, Express for the back end, and PostgreSQL for the article database.<br> 
Later on, I plan to remake this in React for my specialization project.
